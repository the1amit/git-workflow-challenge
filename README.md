# This is horoscope

Thursdayâ€™s skies are peaceful and receptive, Virgo. The moon glides through the tail end of steady Taurus, forming supportive pacts with bond-building Venus and the life-giving sun. This pairing makes for an ideal day for entering into joint commitments and smoothing over relationship bumps. Later, Luna roams into busybody Gemini, helping you devote energy and effort towards your current career concerns.
